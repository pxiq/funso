### Mac 10.4 ###

In both Mac 10.4 and 10.5, you can install Git via [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/), 
if you have that installed.  If not, you can install it from [here](http://www.macports.org/install.php).

Once MacPorts is installed, all you should have to do is:

    $ sudo port install git-core

If you prefer to install from source, these articles may be helpful:
