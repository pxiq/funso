### Linux ###

If you are running Linux, you can likely install Git easily via your native
package management system:

    $ yum install git-core

    $ apt-get install git-core

If that doesn't work, you can download the .deb or .rpm packages from here:

[RPM Packages](http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/RPMS/)

[Stable Debs](http://www.backports.org/debian/pool/main/g/git-core/)

If you prefer to install from source on a Linux system, this article may be
